Running StandardFirmata version 2.2 http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page.
This uses a ATmega1280, quick specs- The Arduino Mega is a 8bit microcontroller board based on the ATmega1280. 
It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, 
an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. 
The Mega is compatible with most shields designed for the Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila.
Allows loading of http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/giicm/ IC pinouts, 
screen capture with timestamp, and because it's java it will run on any platform. 
To complete project software needs to be finished for windows/linux interface.
